\section{\texttt{fakedata.out} contains 200 observations of three random variables: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (each variable in its own column, listed in that order). Calculate the following for this data:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The mean values of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.

    From the code, $\bar{X} = 49.85 \bar{Y} = -1.56, \bar{Z} = -19.38$.

    \item The standard deviations for all thre variables.

    From the code, $\sigma_{X} = 12.75 \sigma_{Y} = 13.63, \sigma_{Z} = 11.06$.

    \item The three correlation coefficients between the three variables.

    From the code, $C_{X,Y} = 0.30 C_{X,Z} = 0.72, C_{Y,Z} = -0.30$.

    \item The skew for $X$, $Y$, and $Z$.
    
    From the code, $\operatorname{Skew}(X) = -0.10 \operatorname{Skew}(Y) = 0.05, \operatorname{Skew}(Z) = -0.31$.
\end{enumerate}
